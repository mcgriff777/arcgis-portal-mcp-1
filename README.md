# arcgis-portal-mcp

**v1.6.0.** 42 tools for ArcGIS Enterprise Portal and ArcGIS Online.

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that gives AI assistants direct access to your ArcGIS content. Search, inspect, edit, publish, and admin through natural language.

Works with Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code Copilot, and any MCP-compatible client.

> **Disclaimer:** This is an independent open-source project. Not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Esri. "ArcGIS" is a registered trademark of Esri.

## What's new in v1.6.0

- **Configurable TLS verification**: certificate verification is now ON by default; set `MCP_TLS_VERIFY=false` for self-signed Enterprise certs
- **Scoped allowlists**: restrict which portals, owners, groups, and service URLs the server can access via `MCP_ALLOWED_*` env vars

### What's new in v1.5.0

- **Item impact analysis**: find out what breaks if you delete an item.
- **Relationship explorer**: map services, web maps, layers, and apps.
- **Usage analytics**: API calls, active users, storage trends (admin).
- **Group membership audit**: who is in which groups, inactive users.
- **Service dependency scanner**: broken links, missing data sources.
- **Batch operations**: update, share, delete multiple items at once.
## Features

- **Connect** to any ArcGIS Enterprise Portal or ArcGIS Online.
- **Search** for items: feature services, web maps, layers, dashboards.
- **Inspect** item metadata, tags, and descriptions.
- **Describe layers**: full schema with fields, domains, subtypes, relationships, and renderer info.
- **Query features** with attribute filters, spatial filters, field selection, and pagination.
- **Add, update, and delete features** in hosted feature layers.
- **Manage content**: update properties, share/unshare, delete items, read web map definitions.
- **Manage users**: list users, get detailed profiles.
- **Manage groups**: list, create, and invite users.
- **Publish services**: upload files and publish as hosted feature services.
- **Inspect GP tools**: list tasks and view parameter schemas before execution.
- **Run geoprocessing**: execute synchronous and asynchronous GP tasks.
- **Export map images**: render layers as JPG/PNG/GIF/PDF/SVG.
- **Portal admin**: system info, license management, usage statistics.
- **Batch operations**: bulk delete, share, and update multiple items.
- **Health check**: portal system status (requires admin privileges).

## Design Principles

- **No `arcgis` Python package dependency**: uses raw REST API calls via `requests`, so you don't need to fight with Esri's Python SDK.
- **Works with Enterprise Portal AND ArcGIS Online**: same tools, same API.
- **Multiple auth methods**: token, username/password, client_credentials, and OAuth2.
- **Auto-connect**: reads your `.env` file on startup, no manual auth needed per session.
- **2FA-friendly**: works with Enterprise portals that require two-factor authentication.
- **Self-signed cert friendly**: handles Enterprise portals with self-signed certificates.
- **Hardened**: SQL injection validation on WHERE clauses, XSS protection in OAuth callbacks, automatic retry with exponential backoff.
- **Scoped allowlists**: optionally restrict which portals, owners, groups, and service URLs the server can access, reducing agent blast radius in production.

## Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Asem-D/arcgis-portal-mcp.git
```

Or clone and install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Asem-D/arcgis-portal-mcp.git
cd arcgis-portal-mcp
pip install -e .
```

**Windows users:** `pywin32` is installed automatically as a platform-specific dependency.

## Configuration

### `.env` File (recommended)

Create a `.env` file for automatic connection on startup. A template is provided:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your portal credentials
```

```env
portal_url=https://gis.example.com/portal
# Option 1: Username/password (recommended for most users)
username=your-portal-username
password=your-portal-password
# Option 2: OAuth2 app credentials (app-level, limited permissions)
# oauth_client_id=your-oauth-app-client-id
# oauth_client_secret=your-oauth-app-client-secret
```

The server searches for `.env` in this order:
1. **Package directory** (next to the server code) — works for source installs
2. **Current working directory** — works when launched from the project root
3. **`~/.arcgis-portal-mcp/.env`** — works for `pip install` users

Quoted values are supported: `password="my secret"`. Existing OS environment variables take precedence over `.env` values.

The server reads `.env` on startup and connects automatically. If `username` + `password` are provided, it uses `generateToken` (user-level, full permissions). Otherwise, it falls back to `client_credentials` (app-level, limited). No manual `connect_portal` call needed.

> **Note:** The `.env` file is gitignored. Never commit credentials. `.env.example` is safe to commit.

### MCP Client Configuration

For MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.), the simplest setup uses a `.env` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "arcgis-portal": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "arcgis_portal_mcp.server"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/arcgis-portal-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

The server auto-connects from `.env` (searched in package dir, CWD, or `~/.arcgis-portal-mcp/`). No env vars needed in the MCP config.

Alternatively, pass credentials via MCP client env vars:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "arcgis-portal": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "arcgis_portal_mcp.server"],
      "env": {
        "portal_url": "https://gis.example.com/portal",
        "username": "your-portal-username",
        "password": "your-portal-password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### `connect_portal` Tool Parameters

The `connect_portal` tool accepts these `auth_method` values:

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `auto` | Read from `.env` (default). Tries username/password first, then client_credentials |
| `username_password` | Portal username + password -> generateToken (user-level) |
| `token` | Use explicit portal token |
| `client_credentials` | Use explicit client_id/secret |
| `oauth2` | Browser-based OAuth2 (blocks ~2 min) |

## Authentication Methods

| Method | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Auto** (default) | Zero-config, reads `.env` on startup | Falls back to app-level if no username/password |
| **Username/Password** | User-level permissions via generateToken | Tokens expire in 2 hours; blocked by 2FA |
| **Token** | Quick, no dependencies | Tokens expire, must be obtained separately |
| **Client Credentials** | No browser needed, no 2FA | App-level only (no user identity) |
| **OAuth2** | Full user permissions, 14-day tokens | Opens browser, blocks for ~2 min |

**Enterprise portals with 2FA:** Use `auto` (`.env` with `client_credentials`). Token auth won't work because 2FA blocks token generation. The `client_credentials` flow uses app-level OAuth2, no browser, no 2FA, no user interaction.

**ArcGIS Online or portals without 2FA:** Username/password auth via `generateToken` is the fastest for MCP. Put `username` and `password` in your `.env` file for auto-connect on startup.

**Full user permissions:** Use OAuth2 once to get a long-lived token, then pass it directly.

## Security

### TLS Certificate Verification

By default, TLS certificate verification is **enabled**. For Enterprise portals with self-signed certificates, disable it in your `.env`:

```env
MCP_TLS_VERIFY=false
```

When verification is disabled, the server logs a warning. Re-enable it for production deployments with valid certificates.

### Scoped Allowlists

For production use, constrain the server to specific portals, owners, groups, and service endpoints. All allowlists are optional; when unset, the server operates without restrictions (backward compatible).

```env
# Only connect to these portals
MCP_ALLOWED_PORTAL_URLS=https://gis.example.com/portal

# Only access items owned by these users
MCP_ALLOWED_OWNERS=jsmith,mgarcia,admin

# Only share with these group IDs
MCP_ALLOWED_GROUPS=abc123,def456

# Only operate on services at these URL prefixes
MCP_ALLOWED_SERVICE_URLS=https://gis.example.com/portal/sharing/rest/services
```

Operations targeting resources outside the allowlist are rejected with a clear error message. For batch operations, items outside the owner allowlist are skipped with per-item reporting.

## What's Next

Here's what we're working on for upcoming releases:

- **`describe_portal`**: A comprehensive portal overview tool that gives you organization details, user counts, storage, and licensing in a single call.
- **`portal_storage_report`**: Detailed breakdown of storage usage by item type, owner, and age.
- **`batch_publish`**: Upload and publish multiple files in one operation.
- **`OAuth2 token refresh`**: Automatic token refresh so you never get logged out mid-session.

If any of these would solve a problem you're facing, [open an issue](https://github.com/Asem-D/arcgis-portal-mcp/issues) and let us know. We prioritize based on real-world needs.
